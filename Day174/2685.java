/*2685. Count the Number of Complete Components

You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete. */
