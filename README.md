# DSA Solutions Browser

This small Node.js + Express app lets you browse your solved `.java` problems and view simple analytics (files per day, average lines, longest files).

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\ANISH\Documents\PROJECTS\DSA-2026"
npm install
```

2. Start server:

```powershell
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes:
- The app scans the repository for `.java` files recursively and serves them.
- The code is intentionally minimal; you can extend search, add syntax highlighting, filtering, or deploy it behind a web server.
